He explained that there are many different gemstones in the market, each with its own unique colors and shades. However, it can be difficult to know which ones are genuine. Astrologer Liton Dewan Chishti advised that an experienced eye is needed to determine whether a gemstone is real or fake. It’s important to look at the gemstone’s shape, color, transparency, and any unwanted substances inside. Using a microscope can help, but the best way to check is to compare the gemstone’s refractive index with a list of known values. This will give an exact identification of the gemstone because there is no significant variation in the refractive index of a particular gemstone.</p>
